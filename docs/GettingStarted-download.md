# Downloading the platform

## Prerequisites

**Git** is required to download the latest version of the Coral platform. Git can be downloaded [here](http://git-scm.com).

**SBT** 0.13.x is required to run the Coral platform. Follow the instructions on how to install SBT on [this](http://www.scala-sbt.org) link. Scala will be downloaded automatically if SBT is run for the first time.

The location of the repository is [https://github.com/coral-streaming/coral.git](https://github.com/coral-streaming/coral.git). Open a new terminal, go to a directory where you want to put the project and type `git clone https://github.com/coral-streaming/coral.git`. A new directory named `coral` will now be created with the project.
Type `cd coral` to go into the project directory.

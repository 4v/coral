# Compiling and Starting the platform

In the project directory, type "sbt" to start SBT. After SBT has started up, type "project runtime-api".
Now, the proper project is set and the main program can be started.
Type "run" to start the program. The program should respond by saying "Running io.coral.api.Boot". This means that the Coral platform is now started up successfully.

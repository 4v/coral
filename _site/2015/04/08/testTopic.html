                <p>Over the course of my career I’ve had quite a few blogs, however I have struggled to maintain writing content for each one. I still write blog posts for <a href="http://blog.stormid.com">-Storm ID-</a> (I’ve left Storm ID. and now work for M&amp;C Saatchi in Australia) but any personal blogs have now all disappeared from various hosting platforms.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The setup</h2>
<p>This blog is hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub pages</a>. GitHub pages allows me to be in control of my blog and makes it super simple to publish a new blog post; it’s as simple as:
	$ git push
Also, by hosting my blog posts on GitHub (should) mean that I won’t loose any of my posts and they will be all version controlled via my git repository.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jekyll</a> is also at the heart of this blog. This is mainly because GitHub pages support it (it was written by one of the co-founders of GitHub after all) and it is a really lightweight way to publish HTML content. Jekyll’s power comes in the form of layouts, templates and plugins. I’m currently using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Daring Fireball’s Markdown</a> as my template engine for my blog post, but the great thing about Jekyll is that I can change to <a href="http://textile.thresholdstate.com/">textile</a> (for example) for any one post and Jekyll will deal with the rest i.e. I can mix ‘n’ match.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I’m an Application Developer living in Sydney, Australia. I’ve been in the development world commercially for 10 years now, but have been an indie developer for much longer.</p>

<p>My core programming language has been C# and the .NET framework, however, the last two years has seen me develop my skills in Objective-C (iOS development), Java (Android development) and even PHP; my current development enviroment of choice is Node.js.</p>

<p>I love building <em>new things</em> and I’m always on the lookout for the next big thing in technology; software or hardware.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h2>
<p>I’ll be writing about anything I think would be useful and will be sharing more about my development <em>stuff</em> as time goes on. Until then, thanks for stopping by.</p>
